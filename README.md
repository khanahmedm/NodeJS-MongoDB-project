## This project is based on CRUD API tutorial available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7UQPve99r4)

This is a simple project but goes over some key concepts of NodeJS and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API operations. The instructor has done an amazing job of explaining different things. I was not familiar with Insomnia (API development tool) and got introduced to it through this course.
